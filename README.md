# SCPDiscord

Currently prints a few different events to a specific Discord channel. I was going to wait until SCP:SL updates to .NET 4.6 but apperently that has been delayed. This means I can't use a discord api directly from the plugin and thus have to seperate it into two different programs.

## Upcoming features:

It's main functionality will be to add functinality to print events such as teamkilling, round restarts and staff actions to a discord channel for an easily accessible log. Some of this is already implemented.

If possible I might also add functionality to print the console to a discord channel and also forward commands from discord to the in-game console.

It will also be able to sync roles from discord to the game which will for instance enable automatic adding of server patrons.
