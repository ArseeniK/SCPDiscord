# SCPDiscord

This will be a Discord-Game bridge for SCP:SL as soon as they switch to .NET 4.6. The current version (using .NET 3.5) does not support async tasks which seem to be required for all .NET Discord APIs.

It's main functionality will be to add functinality to print events such as teamkilling, round restarts and staff actions to a discord channel for an easily accessible log.

If possible I might also add functionality to print the console to a discord channel and also forward commands from discord.
